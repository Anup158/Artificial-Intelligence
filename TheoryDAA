What is Dynamic Programming?
●
Dynamic Programming is also used in optimization problems. Like divide-and-conquer method, Dynamic Programming solves problems by combining the solutions of subproblems.
●
Dynamic Programming algorithm solves each sub-problem just once and then saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the work of re-computing the answer every time.
●
Two main properties of a problem suggest that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming. These properties are overlapping sub-problems and optimal substructure.
●
Dynamic Programming also combines solutions to sub-problems. It is mainly used where the solution of one sub-problem is needed repeatedly. The computed solutions are stored in a table, so that these don‟t have to be re-computed. Hence, this technique is needed where overlapping sub- problem exists.
●
For example, Binary Search does not have overlapping sub-problem. Whereas recursive program of Fibonacci numbers have many overlapping sub-problems.
Steps of Dynamic Programming Approach
Dynamic Programming algorithm is designed using the following four steps −
●
Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
●
Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.
●
Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.
●
Construct an optimal solution from the computed information.

Knapsack Problem
You are given the following-
●
A knapsack (kind of shoulder bag) with limited weight capacity.
●
Few items each having some weight and value.
The problem states-
Which items should be placed into the knapsack such that-
●
The value or profit obtained by putting the items into the knapsack is maximum.
●
And the weight limit of the knapsack does not exceed.
Knapsack Problem Variants
Knapsack problem has the following two variants-
1.
Fractional Knapsack Problem
2.
0/1 Knapsack Problem
0/1 Knapsack Problem-
In 0/1 Knapsack Problem,
●
As the name suggests, items are indivisible here.
●
We can not take a fraction of any item.
●
We have to either take an item completely or leave it completely.
●
It is solved using a dynamic programming approach.

0/1 Knapsack Problem Using Greedy Method-
Consider-
●
Knapsack weight capacity = w
●
Number of items each having some weight and value = n
0/1 knapsack problem is solved using dynamic programming in the following steps-
Step-01:
●
Draw a table say „T‟ with (n+1) number of rows and (w+1) number of columns.
●
Fill all the boxes of 0th row and 0th column with zeroes as shown-
Step-02:
Start filling the table row wise top to bottom from left to right. Use the following formula-
T (i , j) = max { T ( i-1 , j ) , valuei + T( i-1 , j – weighti ) }
Here, T(i , j) = maximum value of the selected items if we can take items 1 to i and have weight restrictions of j.
●
This step leads to completely filling the table.
●
Then, value of the last box represents the maximum possible value that can be put into the knapsack.
Step-03:
●
To identify the items that must be put into the knapsack to obtain that maximum profit,
●
Consider the last column of the table.
●
Start scanning the entries from bottom to top.
●
On encountering an entry whose value is not same as the value stored in the entry immediately above it, mark the row label of that entry.
●
After all the entries are scanned, the marked labels represent the items that must be put into the knapsack

Problem-.
For the given set of items and knapsack capacity = 5 kg, find the optimal solution for the 0/1 knapsack problem making use of a dynamic programming approach.
Solution-
Given
●
Knapsack capacity (w) = 5 kg
●
Number of items (n) = 4
Step-01:
●
Draw a table say „T‟ with (n+1) = 4 + 1 = 5 number of rows and (w+1) = 5 + 1 = 6 number of columns.
●
Fill all the boxes of 0th row and 0th column with 0.
Step-02:
Start filling the table row wise top to bottom from left to right using the formula-
T (i , j) = max { T ( i-1 , j ) , valuei + T( i-1 , j – weighti ) }

Similarly, compute all the entries.
After all the entries are computed and filled in the table, we get the following table-
●
The last entry represents the maximum possible value that can be put into the knapsack.
●
So, maximum possible value that can be put into the knapsack = 7.
Identifying Items To Be Put Into Knapsack
Following Step-04,
●
We mark the rows labelled “1” and “2”.
●
Thus, items that must be put into the knapsack to obtain the maximum value 7 are-

Item-1 and Item-2
Time Complexity-
●
Each entry of the table requires constant time θ(1) for its computation.
●
It takes θ(nw) time to fill (n+1)(w+1) table entries.
●
It takes θ(n) time for tracing the solution since tracing process traces the n rows.
●
Thus, overall θ(nw) time is taken to solve 0/1 knapsack problem using dynamic programming
Conclusion-In this way we have explored Concept of 0/1 Knapsack using Dynamic approch
